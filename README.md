# Underlap (starter)

This is a lightweight Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind starter scaffold created from your requested project tree.

Quickstart

1. Open this folder in VS Code: `c:\Users\ADMIN\Desktop\Underlap`
2. Install dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
```

3. Run development server:

Notes

- This scaffold contains placeholder components and configs. Replace model/component code with your implementation.
